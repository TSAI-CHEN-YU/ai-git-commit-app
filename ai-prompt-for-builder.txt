我想要製作一個小應用，這個應用應該做到以下事情：
- 應用程序目標：使用者選擇一個git倉庫，應用程序會查看該git倉庫中尚未提交的改動，調用生成式AI的API，總結這些改動，產生git提交訊息給使用者
- 應該要非常容易執行，不受環境影響
- 提供簡易使用者介面，使用者可選擇一個資料夾的路徑，選擇後底下有一個文字框會顯示結果，此結果附帶一個複製按鈕，一件複製文字結果
- 調用api的示範：
$ curl https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-3e98e85559a148bcaa0bec93e4c702a9" \
  -d '{
        "model": "deepseek-chat",
        "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
        ],
        "stream": false
      }'
{"id":"db1cc3b2-8363-481f-8719-7eb4060f3165","object":"chat.completion","created":1737621938,"model":"deepseek-chat","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"Hello! How can I assist you today? 😊"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":11,"completion_tokens":11,"total_tokens":22,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0},"prompt_cache_hit_tokens":0,"prompt_cache_miss_tokens":11},"system_fingerprint":"fp_3a5770e1b4"}
- 可能的執行邏輯如下，僅供參考，一切以目標為主，請使用最能達成目標的最佳解決方案:
    * 用git diff取得修改前後差異
    * 給模型事前提示，確保模型應該專注回應任務，事前提示範例：
    You are an expert Git user and software engineer with over a decade of experience in version control systems. Your specialty lies in analyzing git diff outputs and crafting precise, meaningful, and well-structured commit messages that follow best practices, such as using conventional commit types like feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, and chore.  
    Your task is to analyze the git diff output I provide and generate a concise, accurate, and professional commit message that clearly describes the changes made. The commit message should follow the conventional commit format, including a type, optional scope, and a succinct description.  
    Here is the git diff output for you to analyze:  
    __________  
    
    Keep the following in mind while crafting the commit message:  
    
    Focus on the most significant changes and avoid unnecessary details.  
    Use the appropriate commit type (feat, fix, refactor, etc.) based on the nature of the changes.  
    If applicable, include a scope to specify the part of the codebase affected (e.g., (auth), (ui), (api)).  
    Ensure the description is clear, concise, and actionable.  
    If the changes are complex or involve multiple logical changes, consider breaking them into multiple commit messages.
    
    For example, if the git diff shows changes to fix a bug in the authentication module, a good commit message might look like:  
    fix(auth): resolve null pointer exception during login  
    
    Or, if the changes introduce a new feature, it could look like:  
    feat(api): add support for pagination in user list endpoint  
    
    Now, analyze the provided git diff output and generate the most appropriate commit message.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a detailed system prompt for a language model to assist in developing a small application that generates git commit messages using AI.

The application should allow users to select a git repository, identify uncommitted changes, and use a generative AI API to summarize these changes into a git commit message. The application must be easy to execute and environment-independent, featuring a simple user interface where users can select a folder path and view the generated commit message in a text box with a copy button.

# Steps

1. **User Interface Design**: 
   - Create a simple UI with a file picker for selecting a git repository folder.
   - Include a text box to display the generated commit message.
   - Add a button to copy the commit message to the clipboard.

2. **Git Operations**:
   - Use `git diff` to obtain the differences between the current state and the last commit.
   - Ensure the application can handle different environments and configurations.

3. **API Integration**:
   - Integrate with the generative AI API using the provided curl example as a reference.
   - Send the `git diff` output to the API with a system prompt that guides the AI to generate a commit message.

4. **AI Prompt Design**:
   - Use a detailed system prompt to instruct the AI on how to analyze the `git diff` and generate a commit message.
   - Ensure the prompt includes guidelines for using conventional commit types and focusing on significant changes.

5. **Commit Message Generation**:
   - Receive the AI-generated commit message and display it in the UI.
   - Allow users to copy the message with a single click.

# Output Format

The output should be a concise and professional git commit message following the conventional commit format. It should include:
- A commit type (e.g., feat, fix, refactor).
- An optional scope (e.g., (auth), (ui)).
- A succinct description of the changes.

# Examples

**Example 1:**
- **Input**: `git diff` output showing changes to fix a bug in the authentication module.
- **AI Prompt**: "Analyze the following git diff and generate a commit message."
- **Output**: `fix(auth): resolve null pointer exception during login`

**Example 2:**
- **Input**: `git diff` output showing new feature addition in the API.
- **AI Prompt**: "Analyze the following git diff and generate a commit message."
- **Output**: `feat(api): add support for pagination in user list endpoint`

# Notes

- Ensure the AI prompt is clear and instructs the model to focus on significant changes.
- The application should be user-friendly and not require complex setup or dependencies.
- Consider edge
- AI API curl example:
$ curl https://api.deepseek.com/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <DeepSeek API Key>" \
  -d '{

        "messages": [
          {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
          {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
        ],
        "stream": false
      }'
